### üöÄ Local Setup

To run the project, you'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your computer.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [URL-your-repository]
    cd [your-project-name]
    ```

2.  **Configure environment variables**:
    Create the **`.env`** and **`.env.stripe`** files in the root directory of the project (next to `docker-compose.yml`) and add your keys to them.

    ` .env `
    ```env
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=yourkey
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=yourkey
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=yourkey
    # ... other variables, if any
    ```

    ` .env.stripe `

### ‚úÖ Testing Stripe

For local Stripe webhook testing, your `docker-compose.yml` already includes a `stripe-cli` service. It automatically forwards events from your Stripe account to your local application.

To test:
1.  Ensure the `stripe-cli` service is running (use `docker-compose up`).
2.  Create a test payment in your application.
3.  The Stripe webhook will be forwarded to your application, allowing you to simulate real payment events.
